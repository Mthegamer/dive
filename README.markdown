# Dive tools

A company called [Durovis](https://www.durovis.com) recently created a VR headset known as **Dive**. What's special about this headset is that it uses a smartphone as a side-by-side 3D screen.
Some dedicated apps have been created, but they do not work on all phones and their potential is limited due to the limited graphics hardware.


Goal
-----
My idea is to use the Dive in combination with a remote-desktop viewer like [Splashtop](http://www.splashtop.com) to watch and participate in 3D content without the limitations of smartphone hardware.
This would allow one to play e.g. Portal or FPS games while wearing the Dive.

One step further is to also control the PC game using the smartphone. For example, controls could be:
* Look around for mouse control
* Use a slide clicker to control left and right mouse button
* Lean forward/left/right/back to walk
* Jump to jump

Challenges
-----
Remote viewing the PC seems easy. The tricky bit will be extracting accurate information from the phone's sensors and using it to control a PC, without too much latency.

Progress
-----
This project is an experiment conducted in my free time. It will likely be a while before it is usable.
